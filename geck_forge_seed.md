Lazarus Forge — G.E.C.K.

(Genesis / General Environmental Construction Kit)

> Purpose: Define the minimum viable seed required to instantiate a new Lazarus Forge in a fresh location.

The G.E.C.K. is not a factory-in-a-box. It is a capability seed: enough tools, logic, and memory to grow a Forge using local material, salvage, and commerce.




---

I. Definition

A G.E.C.K. is the smallest coherent set of tools, data, and doctrine that can:

1. Preserve embodied complexity (triage before destruction)


2. Create replacement parts for itself


3. Bootstrap power, motion, and fabrication capability


4. Retain memory across generations of artifacts



If a deployed kit cannot eventually rebuild itself, it is not a true seed.


---

II. When a G.E.C.K. Is Deployed

A G.E.C.K. is appropriate when:

Infrastructure is sparse, damaged, or absent

Supply chains are unreliable or nonexistent

Salvage is abundant relative to new manufacturing

Human presence is limited or temporary


Typical scenarios:

Remote terrestrial locations

Disaster recovery zones

Frontier industrial sites

Early orbital / lunar deployments



---

III. G.E.C.K. Capability Threshold (v0 → v1 Bridge)

A G.E.C.K. must support v0 Forge operations immediately, and enable growth toward v1 using local means.


---

IV. Core G.E.C.K. Modules (Critical)

1. Power & Energy Module

Portable generation (engine, solar, or hybrid)

Energy storage (batteries, capacitors)

Power conditioning and distribution


Reason: No power, no learning.


---

2. Triage & Salvage Module

Multimeter

Basic electrical loads

Hand tools

Marking and tagging system


Reason: The Forge must recognize value before it destroys it.


---

3. Motion & Actuation Module

At least one reliable motor

Linear motion components (rails, screws, belts)

Basic bearings and couplings


Reason: Motion enables every other capability.


---

4. Fabrication Module (Minimal)

Small metal AM system or CNC / hybrid tool

Manual machining tools (drill press, grinder)

Welding or joining capability


Reason: The seed must be able to repair and extend itself.


---

5. Thermal Module

Heat source capable of controlled temperatures

Basic temperature measurement

Insulation and containment


Reason: Metallurgy begins with heat control.


---

6. Sensing & Metrology Module

Calipers and micrometers

Scale

Simple optical inspection


Reason: Discernment requires measurement.


---

7. Memory & Doctrine Module

Local compute

Durable storage media

Core Lazarus Forge documents

Artifact and triage logs (digital or paper)


Reason: Without memory, growth resets every generation.


---

8. Human Interface Module

Manual overrides

Clear labeling

Simple operator instructions


Reason: Early Forges are taught, not autonomous.


---

V. What a G.E.C.K. Deliberately Does NOT Include

High-throughput automation

Exotic alloys

Full autonomy

Space-rated hardware (unless mission-specific)


These emerge through growth, not seeding.


---

VI. G.E.C.K. Success Criteria

A deployed G.E.C.K. is considered successful when it can:

Replace its own failed components

Upgrade at least one module using local material

Generate surplus value through repair or fabrication

Preserve and transfer its operational memory



---

VII. Scaling Beyond the Seed

Once self-replacement is proven, the Forge graduates:

G.E.C.K. → v1 Forge: Closed-loop material recycling

v1 → v2: Reduced human dependency

v2 → v3: In-situ resource utilization



---

VIII. Guiding Axioms

A seed that cannot grow is cargo.

Tools matter less than the order they are used.

Memory is the most compact machine.

This document defines the minimal conditions for Forge genesis and should change only with demonstrated field experience.
