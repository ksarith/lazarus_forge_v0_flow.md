# Lazarus Forge — Spin Chamber (v0)

> **Design doctrine:** slow, steady, methodical work beats speed. The Spin Chamber favors time, stability, and survivability over peak throughput.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Spin Chamber is the keystone module of Lazarus Forge. It converts mixed metallic scrap into **ranked material streams** using overlapping physical biases (heat, rotation, and electromagnetic fields). The goal is *progressive enrichment* and *capability replication*, not single‑pass purity.

This v0 design prioritizes:

* Long operational life
* Predictable behavior
* Modular repair
* Bootstrap compatibility (built from salvage, improves itself over generations)

---

## 2. Operating Principle (High Level)

1. **Induction melting** homogenizes incoming scrap.
2. **Slow rotation** biases the melt radially by density.
3. **Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) damping** stabilizes flow and suppresses turbulence.
4. **Time under bias** allows impurities to migrate and segregate.
5. **Selective extraction** (tapping / extrusion) routes material by role.

The chamber does not aim to produce “pure metal.” It produces **useful gradients**.

## 3. System Overview

**Stationary outer shell**

* Structural containment
* Thermal insulation
* Houses coils and sensors

**Rotating inner crucible**

* Contains molten metal
* Provides centrifugal bias

**External induction coils**

* Heat source
* Optional MHD field shaping

**Drive module**

* Low RPM rotation
* High tolerance to imbalance

**Extraction interfaces**

* Slag skim
* Radial taps (optional)
* Centerline wire extrusion (future‑ready)

---

## 4. Scale & Geometry (v0 Envelope)

* **Internal diameter:** 200–250 mm
* **Internal height:** 200–300 mm
* **Melt volume:** 5–10 L
* **Batch mass:** ~10–25 kg (Al class)

**Crucible geometry:**

* Rounded conical or shallow paraboloid bottom
* No flat surfaces
* Generous radii to avoid dead zones

**Wall thickness:**

* Graphite: 10–15 mm
* Ceramic: 15–25 mm

---

## 5. Materials

**Crucible (v0):**

* Graphite (preferred; sacrificial, forgiving)
* Alumina / mullite ceramics (acceptable)

**Outer shell:**

* Refractory liner
* Insulation layer
* Structural steel jacket

**Design note:** Wear is acceptable. Sudden failure is not.

---

## 6. Rotation System

* **Operating RPM:** 50–300
* **Nominal RPM:** 100–150
* **Never exceed (v0):** 400

**Drive philosophy:**

* External motor
* Belt or chain drive
* Slip or clutch preferred
* Alignment by geometry, not precision machining

---

## 7. Heating & Thermal Strategy

**Heating:**

* External induction coils
* Single zone acceptable for v0
* Power range: 5–15 kW

**Temperature bands (Al class):**

* Hot idle: 500–550 °C
* Processing: 650–720 °C

**Thermal doctrine:**

* Maintain **near‑constant elevated temperature**
* Avoid full thermal cycling
* Stop rotation before cooling

This dramatically extends crucible and coil life.

---

## 8. Electromagnetic Fields (v0)

* No electrodes in melt
* No electrochemical assumptions
* Induction fields provide heating and incidental MHD effects
* Optional auxiliary coils for millitesla‑scale flow damping

Purpose is **stability**, not forceful separation.

---

## 9. Atmosphere Control

* Passive reducing environment preferred
* Charcoal bed or inert purge if available
* Oxygen ingress minimized, not eliminated

Precision gas chemistry is out of scope for v0.

---

## 10. Extraction & Outputs

**Primary outputs:**

* Slag / oxide layer (skimmed)
* Bulk structural alloy
* Composition‑biased inner fraction

**Wire extrusion (planned path):**

* Centerline bottom tap
* Heated, replaceable nozzle
* Diameter controlled by draw speed

Wire is the preferred first product for self‑replication.

---

## 11. Instrumentation & Control

**Required sensing:**

* Temperature (2–3 points)
* Motor current
* Induction power draw
* Vibration (coarse accelerometer acceptable)

**Control philosophy:**

* Thresholds and states
* Slow ramps
* Long dwell times

Example rule:

> If vibration increases for 10 minutes, reduce RPM.

---

## 12. Operating Mode

* Batch operation
* Long holds (hours, not minutes)
* Hot idle between runs

Speed is never a success metric.

---

## 13. Expected Outcomes (v0)

**Expect:**

* Predictable segregation trends
* Improved consistency over time
* Learnable wear patterns

**Do not expect:**

* High purity
* High throughput
* Cosmetic perfection

If behavior is stable and repeatable, the chamber is successful.

---

## 14. Failure Philosophy

Acceptable:

* Crucible wear
* Slag buildup
* Gradual vibration drift

Unacceptable:

* Runaway RPM
* Melt breach
* Explosive failure

Design to fail **slowly and visibly**.

---

## 15. Role in Self‑Replicating Foundry Logic

The Spin Chamber is a **material router**. Its outputs feed:

* Structural fabrication
* Coil and motor upgrades
* Thermal and refractory improvements

Each generation improves the next. Older chambers remain useful.

---

## 16. Summary

The Spin Chamber is not a purifier. It is a patient system that nudges matter toward order using time, gravity, and fields.

> **Slow spin. Hot idle. Long life.**

This is the tortoise.
